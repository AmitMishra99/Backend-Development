# Module Wrapper

### Before a module's code is execuited, Node.js will wrap it

### IIFE : Immediately Inovked Function Expression

### with a function wrapper that looks like the following👇

 (function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
      <module code>
 })()


### By doing this, Node.js achieves a few things 👇

### 👉 It keeps top-level variables (defined with var, let, const) scoped to the module rather then global object.

### 👉 It helps to provide some global-looking variables that are

### actually specific to the module.

# Arguments

### exports: Allows us to export data from one file to other(s).

### require: Allows us to import data from one file to another.

### module: A reference to the current module.

### \_\_dirname: Directory name of the current module.

### \_\_filename: The filename of the current module.
